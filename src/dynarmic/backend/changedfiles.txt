block_range_information.cpp:
erase_locations: If you know the approximate number of elements that will be inserted into erase_locations, you can use the reserve function to preallocate memory. 
This can potentially improve performance by reducing the number of memory reallocations.
Use emplace Instead of insert: The emplace function constructs the element in-place and can be more efficient than insert, which creates a temporary object.
